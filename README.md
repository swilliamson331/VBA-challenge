# VBA-challenge
The vbs file in this repository is a code that will loop through all stock tickers in column A in an excel file, across all worksheets. the code creates a summary table for each individual stock, pulling their quarterly change, precent change in that quarter, and their total trading volume. In another table, it will pull the greatest increase and decrease in stock price, along with which stock had the largest total trading volume in that quarter. The screenshots in this repository show results from each quarter.

I used reference to previous class activities for this assignment, namely credit card checker and student census pt 1. I also used google for help on a couple of syntaxes, such as conditional formatting for colors and percent.
